## Employment ##
### January 2017 - June 2019: Technical Lead - Senior Software Engineer, Telstra ###

__*Role overview:*__  I led the redevelopment of [the RFNSA website](https://www.rfnsa.com.au), a high volume public website that is vital in supporting the mobile communications industry in satisfying its regulatory requirements for mobile network deployment. As well as providing community consultation functions such as informing the public of the Electro Magnetic Emission (EME) levels, the website also supports a wide variety of regulatory and administrative processes carried out behind the scenes by mobile carriers. My role was to provide technical leadership and mentorship to the development team in adopting best practice Agile and software development methodologies, as well as to be responsible for the design of the technical solution itself.

__*Points of interst:*__
Introduced the team to and trained them in Agile methodologies, including:
    - Agile style daily stand-ups, ie. Scrum. (Completed in under 2 minutes).
    - How to write user stories, including breaking tasks into smaller stories,
      estimation of story points and organising them within epics
    - Analysised user requirements and provided the complete documentation and
      creation of user stories for various subsystems

      processes, such as Kanban
Introduced Continuous Deployment / Continuous Integration (CI/CD) to the
team, including:
    - Installed, configured and maintained a Jenkins instance
    - Designed and created Jenkins jobs for providing automated testing,
      automated deployment and one-click deployment to production. These functions
      significantly reduced deployment time and reduced code defects.
    - Trained the team in how to use Jenkins and how to write automated tests.
Introduced Peer Reviews to the team, including:
    - Training the team in the Peer Review process and performing the majority
      of peer reviews myself. This was a key means of training developers in
      the use of Python/Django which was new to the team.
    - Setting up of the git repositories
    - Guiding migration of existing CVS, SVN and TFS repositories into git.
    - Teaching the team members how to use git, both within the CLI, within
      PyCharm and other frontends
    - Use of git tagging to track versions
Responsible in architecting solutions to the entirety of the project scope, including:
    - Devising an architecture that would allow the rewritten Python/Django
      application to be deployed as a hybird system with the legacy Perl
      application, necessary to allow the team to deploy new functionality in
      an incremental and Agile manner
    - Full environmental configuration for the application, including Linux,
      nginx, MySQL, uwsgi, perl, memcached, MySQL
    - Extending Django&#39;s ORM to provide a modular approach to supporting
      extensive legacy data schemas

      robust design and implementation, supporting ease of incremental development and maintenance
    - Developed performence tests and optimised the environmental
      configuration, application logic and database queries to facilitate high volume load
    - Created an application documentation system which generates automatically from code

In this role I have demonstrated that with my extensive understanding software development, I can build and support team capacity to deliver complex technical challenges using the latest software development processes and technologies.

### April 2016 - October 2016: Developer, The Optical Superstore ###
__*Primary Skills used:*__ Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, React, Electron

__*Role overview:*__ Responsible for designing and building a custom CRM / communications platform for a national retail chain. System comprised of SMS gateway integration and reporting system (built on Django), a Flask/Potion based REST API located in each store which integrated with a legacy Database via SQLAlchemy, and thirdly, a frontend application written using React and deployed as a standalone application using Electron, to run on multiple systems within each store.

__*Interesting challenges*__

- The legacy database was originally created for Microsoft Access and extensively utilised composite keys. The database had been migrated to Postgres and support for the composite keys was obtained by using Flask with SQLAlchemy. The Flask Potion REST Framework was extended to support the composite keys.
- Developed a Windows installer to install and provide updates to the in-store computer front-end.
- Each of the three codebases were extensively linted, tested and documented.

### April 2015 - April 2016: Senior Developer, QuantumIT (assigned to Telstra -- Cloud Engineering) ###

__*Primary Skills used:*__ Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Celery

__*Role overview:*__ As senior developer in a team ranging up to ten developers, I provided significant technical leadership in maintaining and extending a cloud automation platform for Telstra. The platform acted as an API gateway, exposing a REST interface to Telstra&#39;s internal and external users and integrating downstream with various Telstra and 3rd party APIs. We worked with various teams across Telstra to bring multiple new products through from discovery, design, development, deployment and maintenance.

__*Interesting challenges:*__

- Quickly developed a strong understanding of network layer 2 and 3 design
  concepts as the developer responsible for the network provisioning sub-system (Anuta).
- Became an expert in Django Rest Framework, implementing extensive serialisation and custom endpoints (ViewSets) to facilitate complex JSON payloads, asynchronous design patterns, and extensible coding.
- I was responsible for formulating the team&#39;s git workflow including writing deploy scripts, githooks and Gitlab and Jenkins integration.
- Supported deployment to Openshift as a cloud platform by resolving various environmental issues such as resolving log rotation issues, database vacuuming, process keepalives
- Converted design documents into user stories, allowing the team to rationalise user requirements, keep requirement conversations on track and effectively plan delivery within allowed timeframes.
- Platforms (APIs) we integrated with included AWS, IBM SoftLayer, VMware Vcloud Air and Microsoft Azure.

### February 2013 - April 2015: Developer, Infoxchange Australia ###

__*Primary Skills used:*__ Python, Django, JavaScript, Backbone.js, Perl

__*Role overview:*__ Full stack developer, designing, architecting and building various features and solutions, as well as maintaining existing solutions. BDD & TDD principles were followed, with all features having browser tests and unit tests prior to merging. Size of development team ranged from 4 to 7 developers. Agile methodologies were followed, with sprints, scrums (daily stand-up) and a kanban board. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (including automation of builds and deployment) were practiced.

__*Interesting challenges:*__

- A large project, encompassing multiple components (deployed as microservices) required a user management application to allow admin users to manage user settings that resided across the various microservices (including the single sign-on application, which was a legacy, multi-tennanted application). I made a significant contribution to the user management application, building RESTful integration endpoints (using Tastypie) within the integrated applications, and the user-interface in the admin application, which itself was a Django application.
- One component of the project was a Service Directory of community health
	services. Its backend was implemented using Elasticsearch with a Django-Tastypie REST interface. I was the lead developer for the frontend, which was built using Backbone.js and Leaflet for mapping integration. I co-ordinated two remote working developers, completing the project within a tight timeframe. The frontend application that I developed was later successfully ported into two separate repackaged applications that were sold to other clients.
- Due to restrictions around personal health data, we were required to host our applications in house, within geographic Australia. We became early adopters of the Docker framework. This allowed for deterministic builds that could seamlessly transfer from one environment to the next. I established the Docker build process for the forum/groups component which was built using Drupal.
- A legacy application created over ten years ago and written in Perl constituted a significant amount of technical debt for the organisation. I made a significant contribution to paying down this technical debt in porting the application to the newer Mojolicious framework, Docker, fixing various bugs and adding new features that prolonged the marketability of the product.
- I performed Business Analysis, writing user stories for a community project based on which provided self-education material for individuals wishing to develop proficiency with various consumer technologies.

### June 2012 - 2013 Lead Developer, Koodoz Design ###

__*Primary Skills used:*__ PHP, Yii, CakePHP, OpenCart, Wordpress Python, Django, jQuery

__*Role overview:*__ Sole developer at an established digital agency. Maintained numerous, primarily PHP, websites that had been built by the previous developer. Mentored the designer in taking on more complex JavaScript development. Built new websites in a high pressure digital agency scenario.

__*Interesting challenges:*__

- Built a CMS using the Yii framework, which integrated with a customer&#39;s
  product database using an endpoint that I developed and deployed into the customer&#39;s environment.
- Integrated an existing ecommerce site built with CakePHP with a customer&#39;s SAP system for product fulfillment.
- Implemented NAB Transact on an existing site, providing a credit card payment facility,
- Integrated a WordPress site with a customer&#39;s Django application, allowing for seamless customer registration.
- Since I was the primary technical person on staff, I performed all the server management, including setting up a new development environment for the other staff.
- Provided maintenance, such as adding new features, to numerous legacy client

### 2011 - 2012 Mobile Developer, Agility Interactive ###

__*Primary Skills used:*__ PHP, Doctrine, Smarty, jQuery, jQueryMobile

__*Role overview:*__ This was a small organisation (essentially a startup) that had created a new community-based betting website called Favourite.com. Prior to launch, I was hired to port the existing web application into a mobile format, using jQueryMobile. This primarily involved writing new Views, Controllers and Templates to support the mobile application. TDD practices were followed and all features had an integration test prior to merging. Continuous Integration (build automation) was practiced.

__*Interesting challenges:*__

- PHP bindings with Selenium were primitive at this time. When I added capabilities to the Selenium library, I would upstream them on github.
- I was responsible for becoming the expert in jQueryMobile and devising how jQueryMobile would be used vis-a-vis the existing application.
- Used AJAX extensively throughout the application in order to provide prompt responses to user actions.
- Features built included: user registration sequence, login and account settings pages, Facebook style activity feed (which polled the server for new updates), hierarchical site navigation (with prefetch of child pages), 'betslip' (analogous to a shopping cart, allowing queuing of bets), lost password sequence, bet receipt, site search (with filtering).
