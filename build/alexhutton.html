<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I am an intermediate, full-stack Web Developer, with 7 years experience working in web, including 3.5 years as a software engineer. I have exposure to a variety of languages and frameworks, including Python, Django, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>What I love most about working with technology is solving problems creatively.</p>
<p>I value simplicity in design, which is why I chose to use Backbone.js over a more comprehensive framework when building a search engine frontend at Infoxchange. Its capabilities met our requirements without adding unnecessary complexity, allowing us to deliver the product faster.</p>
<p>Test-Driven Development is a way of simplifying the process of writing code itself, allowing me to easily verify that what I have written is correct. The resulting automated test suite then provides confidence that any regressions later introduced will be caught.</p>

<h3 id="february-2013---current-developer-infoxchange-australia">February 2013 - Current: Developer, Infoxchange Australia</h3>
<p><strong><em>Primary Skills used:</em></strong> Python, Django, JavaScript, Backbone.js, Perl</p>
<p><strong><em>Role overview:</em></strong> Full stack developer, designing, architecting and building various features and solutions, as well as maintaining existing solutions. BDD &amp; TDD principles were followed, with all features having a Lettuce tests and unit tests prior to merging. All code is peer reviewed. Size of development team ranged from 4 to 7 developers. Agile methodologies were followed, with sprints, scrums (daily stand-up) and a kanban board. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (including automation of builds and deployment) were practiced.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interesting challenges:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large project, encompassing multiple components (deployed as microservices) required a user management application to allow admin users to manage user settings that resided across the various microservices (including the single sign-on application, which was a legacy, multi-tennanted application). I made a significant contribution to the user management application, building RESTful integration endpoints (using Tastypie) in integrated applications and user-interface in the admin application, which itself was a Django application.</li>
<li>One component of the project was a Service Directory of community health services. The backend of this was implemented using Elasticsearch with a Django-Tastypie REST interface. I was the lead developer for the frontend, which was built using Backbone.js and Leaflet to provide mapping. I co-ordinated two other developers, who were remote workers, in order to complete this frontend application within the timeframe. The frontend application that I developed was later successfully ported into two separate repackaged applications that were sold to other clients.</li>
<li>Due to restriction around personal health data, we were required to host our applications in house, within geographic Australia. We choose to become early adopters of the Docker framework. This allowed for deterministic builds that effortlessly graduated from one environment to the next. I established the Docker build process for the forum/groups component which was built using Drupal.</li>
<li>A legacy application created over ten years ago and written in Perl constituted a significant amount of technical debt for the organisation. I made a significant contribution to paying down this technical debt in porting the application to the newer Mojolicious framework, Docker, fixing various bugs and adding new features that prolonged the marketability of the product.</li>
<li>I performed Business Analysis, writing user stories for a community project based on which provided self-education material for individuals wishing to develop proficiency with various consumer technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Primary Skills used:</em></strong> PHP, Yii, CakePHP, OpenCart, Wordpress Python, Django, jQuery</p>
<p><strong><em>Role overview:</em></strong> Sole developer at an established digital agency. Maintained numerous, primarily PHP, websites that had been built by the previous developer. Mentored the designer in taking on more complex JavaScript development. Built new websites in a high pressure digital agency scenario.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interesting challenges:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Built a CMS using the Yii framework, which integrated with a customer's product database using an endpoint that I developed and deployed into the customer's environment.</li>
<li>Integrated an existing ecommerce site built with CakePHP with a customer's SAP system for product fulfillment.</li>
<li>Implemented NAB Transact on an existing site, providing a credit card payment facility,</li>
<li>Integrated a WordPress site with a customer's Django application, allowing for seamless customer registration.</li>
<li>Since I was the primary technical person on staff, I performed all the server management, including setting up a new development environment for the other staff.</li>
<li>Provided maintenance, such as adding new features, to numerous legacy client</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-developer-agility-interactive">2011 - 2012 Mobile Developer, Agility Interactive</h3>
<p><strong><em>Primary Skills used:</em></strong> PHP, Doctrine, Smarty, jQuery, jQueryMobile</p>
<p><strong><em>Role overview:</em></strong> This was a small organisation (essentially a startup) that had created a new community betting website called Favourite.com. Prior to launch, I was hired to port the existing web application into a mobile format, using jQueryMobile. This primarily involved writing new Views, Controllers and templates to support the mobile application. TDD practices were followed and all features had an integration test prior to merging. Continuous Integration (build automation) was practiced.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interesting challenges:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PHP bindings with Selenium were primitive at this time. When I added capabilities to the Selenium library, I would upstream them on github.</li>
<li>I was responsible for becoming the expert in jQueryMobile and devising how jQueryMobile would be used vis-a-vis the existing application.</li>
<li>Used AJAX extensively throughout the application in order to provide prompt responses to user actions.</li>
<li>Features built included: user registration sequence, login and account settings pages, Facebook style activity feed (which polled the server for new updates), hierarchical site navigation (with prefetch of child pages), 'betslip' (analogous to a shopping cart, allowing queuing of bets), lost password sequence, bet receipt, site search (with filtering).</li>
