<p><strong><em>Role overview:</em></strong> I led the redevelopment of <a href="https://www.rfnsa.com.au">the RFNSA website</a>, a high volume public website that is vital in supporting the mobile communications industry in satisfying its regulatory requirements for mobile network deployment. As well as providing community consultation functions, such as informing the public of the Electromagnetic Emission (EME) levels, the website also supports a wide variety of regulatory and administrative processes carried out behind the scenes by mobile carriers. My role was to provide technical leadership and mentorship to the development team in adopting best practice Agile and software development methodologies, as well as to be responsible for the design of the technical solution itself.</p>

</ul>
<p>Responsible in architecting solutions to the entirety of the project scope, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devising an architecture that would allow the rewritten Python/Django application to be deployed as a hybrid system with the legacy Perl application, necessary to allow the team to deploy new functionality in an incremental and Agile manner</li>
<li>Full environmental configuration for the application, including Linux, nginx, MySQL, uwsgi, perl, memcached, MySQL</li>
<li>Extending Django's ORM to provide a modular approach to supporting the extensive legacy data schemas</li>

<p><strong><em>Primary Skills used:</em></strong> Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, React, Electron</p>
<p><strong><em>Role overview:</em></strong> Responsible for designing and building a custom CRM / communications platform for a national retail chain. System comprised of SMS gateway integration and reporting system (built on Django), a Flask/Potion based REST API located in each store which integrated with a legacy Database via SQLAlchemy, and thirdly, a frontend application written using React and deployed as a standalone application using Electron, to run on multiple systems within each store.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interesting challenges</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The legacy database was originally created for Microsoft Access and extensively utilised composite keys. The database had been migrated to Postgres and support for the composite keys was obtained by using Flask with SQLAlchemy. The Flask Potion REST Framework was extended to support the composite keys.</li>
<li>Developed a Windows installer to install and provide updates to the in-store computer front-end.</li>
<li>Each of the three codebases were extensively linted, tested and documented.</li>

<h3 id="february-2013---april-2015-developer-infoxchange-australia">February 2013 - April 2015: Developer, Infoxchange Australia</h3>
<p><strong><em>Primary Skills used:</em></strong> Python, Django, JavaScript, Backbone.js, Perl</p>
<p><strong><em>Role overview:</em></strong> Full stack developer, designing, architecting and building various features and solutions, as well as maintaining existing solutions. BDD &amp; TDD principles were followed, with all features having browser tests and unit tests prior to merging. Size of development team ranged from 4 to 7 developers. Agile methodologies were followed, with sprints, scrums (daily stand-up) and a kanban board. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (including automation of builds and deployment) were practiced.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interesting challenges:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large project, encompassing multiple components (deployed as microservices) required a user management application to allow admin users to manage user settings that resided across the various microservices (including the single sign-on application, which was a legacy, multi-tenanted application). I made a significant contribution to the user management application, building RESTful integration endpoints (using Tastypie) within the integrated applications, and the user-interface in the admin application, which itself was a Django application.</li>
<li>One component of the project was a Service Directory of community health services. Its backend was implemented using Elasticsearch with a Django-Tastypie REST interface. I was the lead developer for the frontend, which was built using Backbone.js and Leaflet for mapping integration. I coordinated two remote working developers, completing the project within a tight timeframe. The frontend application that I developed was later successfully ported into two separate repackaged applications that were sold to other clients.</li>
<li>Due to restrictions around personal health data, we were required to host our applications in house, within geographic Australia. We became early adopters of the Docker framework. This allowed for deterministic builds that could seamlessly transfer from one environment to the next. I established the Docker build process for the forum/groups component which was built using Drupal.</li>
<li>A legacy application created over ten years ago and written in Perl constituted a significant amount of technical debt for the organisation. I made a significant contribution to paying down this technical debt in porting the application to the newer Mojolicious framework, Docker, fixing various bugs and adding new features that prolonged the marketability of the product.</li>
<li>I performed Business Analysis, writing user stories for a community project based on which provided self-education material for individuals wishing to develop proficiency with various consumer technologies.</li>
</ul>
